## IC Cron example

This directory is the example project that demonstrates usage of `ic-cron` library.

Here we have a simple automatic counting canister, that have two independent counters each of which get incremented by a
cron-scheduled task enqueued by remote user.

Execute the [e2e-test](../e2e-test) locally to see how it works.
